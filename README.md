This technical report explores the deployment of a static HTML website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to demonstrate cloud administration expertise. Leveraging AWS services such as S3 Buckets, Route 53, and CloudFront, a secure and scalable website was configured under the custom domain henryreallywantsajob.com. Key steps included enabling static website hosting in S3, configuring public access through Access Control Lists and bucket policies, and linking the custom domain using Route 53 DNS records. To enhance performance and security, a CloudFront distribution was established with HTTPS enforcement, supported by an SSL certificate issued via AWS Certificate Manager. The result is a fully operational static website accessible via HTTPS, showcasing proficiency in designing and managing efficient cloud-based solutions. This project demonstrates best practices for balancing accessibility, scalability, and security in cloud environments.
